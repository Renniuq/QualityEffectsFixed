This is a straight rip of the Quality Effects mod by Andrey135296, original repository here: https://github.com/Andrey135296/Factorio-QualityEffects

However, while I originally forked that repository, it doesn't use the factorio-mod-template by fgardt, so the mod upload process involved a *lot* of manual work. In the 3 times I had to manually upload the mod, I'd made a mistake in that process twice. I don't feel like taking that risk (and having to fix it) another time, so I've decided to not fork the original repository, reuse the template from fgardt, and upload as a new repository.
